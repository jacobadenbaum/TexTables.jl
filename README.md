The TexTable package provides an easy way for Julia users to quickly
build well-formated and publication-ready ASCII and LaTeX tables from a
variety of different data structures.  It allows the user to easily
build complex tables from small, modular components in an object
oriented fashion, as well as providing some methods for easily
constructing common tables from regression output.

This package is still in beta.  I'm quite happy with it and I've been
using it (or some iteration of it) in my own work for quite a while.
But I'd appreciate feedback, feature requests, or pull requests (if you
want to help!).
